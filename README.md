# Creative coding major project

## interactive Description
This code is based on the group work, but adding extra functions on it. There are three main pages over here. To switch among three page, you can simply press key '2', '3', and 'c'. 

On page '2', you can increase, decrease the width and hight of the artwork by press keys 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'. On page '3', mouse actions are available. Keep pressing the left key of mouse to rotate and pressing right key to transform it. Zoom in and out are also available if you scroll your roller. 

## individual approach
Based on the group project, I developed 3D dynamic effects. If you press key 2, it will switch to a 2D plane state where squares and small squares simulate the fast flow and jitter of vehicles. In this state, pressing the up or down arrow keys will increase or decrease the height of the shapes, while pressing the left and right arrow keys will increase or decrease their width. If you press key 3, you will get a 3D shape. By pressing the left mouse button, you can freely rotate the shape to view its details; by holding the right mouse button, you can pan the shape; and by scrolling the mouse wheel, you can zoom in or out. Pressing key C will return you to the initial page.
